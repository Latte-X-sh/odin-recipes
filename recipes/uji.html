        Just to quickly define uji, it’s basically a thin porridge made from different blends of flour ranging from wimbi(millet), mahindi (corn), sorghum among others.
        It’s eaten for breakfast and it’s quite filling. I had uji religiously until I was 13 because it helped me stay fuller longer.
        Karibu Sana!
