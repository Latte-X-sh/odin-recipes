    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>8-10 medium sized potatoes</li>
        <li>1 cup of Gram Flour</li>
        <li>3 cloves of minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of Fresh/powdered</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon of turmeric</li>       <li>1 tablespoon of coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of paprika</li>      <li>½ teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>Chilli powder</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Chopped coriander dhania</li>
        <li>1 cup of water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and clean them thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Slice then into thin round slices.</li>
        <li>Not as thin as potato crisps, but not as thick as chips(fries)</li>
        <li>Let them soak in clean water for about 5 minutes to help get rid of any extra starch.</li>
        <li>Rinse thoroughly about 3 times, until the water runs clear.</li>
        <li>Drain the water and dry them completely using either kitchen or paper towels.</li>
        <li>This step of drying is important because it ensures that the Bhajia batter is not watered down as you coat the potatoes.</li>
        <li>Mix all the ingredients of the batter and add the water slowly until you get an even thick consistency.</li>
        <li>Aim for a consistency that is slightly thinner than pancake batter.</li>
    </ol>
